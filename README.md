### **🌍 AI-Powered Game Engine - Procedural World Generation**  

Welcome to our **AI-powered game engine**! 🚀 This project is focused on **procedural world generation**, where terrains, landscapes, and game environments are dynamically generated using AI.  

---

## **📌 Features Implemented So Far**  

✅ **Procedural Terrain Generation** 🏞️  
- Generates realistic landscapes using **Perlin Noise**.  
- Dynamic heightmaps for hills, valleys, and plains.  

✅ **Basic Rendering System** 🎨  
- Uses **OpenGL** to render terrain.  
- Simple **vertex-based terrain visualization**.  

✅ **AI-Driven Heightmap Generation** 🤖  
- Uses **FastNoise2** to create natural, randomized terrain.  

✅ **Basic Color Shading** 🌄  
- Terrain color changes dynamically based on height.

## **🚀 Features Coming Soon**  

🔹 **3D Object Placement (Trees, Rocks, Buildings) 🌲🏠**  
- AI-driven object placement using noise-based randomization.  

🔹 **Texture Mapping & Advanced Shading 🎨**  
- Apply high-quality terrain textures for a realistic look.  
- Add dynamic lighting and shadow effects.  

🔹 **AI-Based NPC Behavior 🤖**  
- Implement NPC movement and decision-making using behavior trees.  

🔹 **Game Logic Scripting (Lua/Python) 🔥**  
- Support for custom game logic without modifying C++ code.  

🔹 **Dynamic Weather & Environment System ☀️🌧️**  
- AI-generated weather changes (rain, snow, fog).
